# Organization Chart Page Fix

## Problem Summary
The organization chart page (`http://localhost:3001/organization-chart`) works fine on localhost but shows empty content in production - no names or images display.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Missing Database Data**
- The organization chart page loads data from database setting `organization_chart_data`
- **This data was missing from the production database**
- Without this data, the page falls back to hardcoded default values

### 2. **Invalid Fallback URLs**
- The fallback hardcoded Cloudinary URLs were either invalid or expired
- Default data used outdated Cloudinary image paths
- This caused empty images even when fallback was used

### 3. **Poor Error Handling**
- The original code didn't provide sufficient logging for production debugging
- No clear indication of which data source was being used
- Silent failures made troubleshooting difficult

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Created Organization Chart Data** ✅
- Created `scripts/setup-org-chart-data.js` to populate database
- Added all 7 committee positions with proper names
- Data structure matches the template expectations

### 2. **Improved Error Handling** ✅
- Enhanced logging to show data source (database/local storage/default)
- Added detailed error messages for debugging
- Better fallback logic with null photo handling

### 3. **Fixed Default Fallback** ✅
- Removed invalid hardcoded Cloudinary URLs
- Set photo values to `null` to show placeholder icons
- Emergency fallback data in case of critical errors

### 4. **Production Deployment Script** ✅
- Created `scripts/fix-production-org-chart.js`
- Provides step-by-step instructions for production fix
- Includes backup and verification steps

## Files Modified

### Updated Files:
1. **`server-new.js`** - Enhanced organization chart route with better error handling
2. **Created Scripts:**
   - `scripts/setup-org-chart-data.js` - Populates database with org chart data
   - `scripts/fix-production-org-chart.js` - Production deployment fix

## How to Deploy Fix to Production

### Step 1: Run the Fix Script
```bash
# On your production server
node scripts/fix-production-org-chart.js
```

### Step 2: Restart Application
```bash
# If using PM2
pm2 restart all

# If using Docker
docker restart your-container

# If using Heroku
heroku restart --app your-app-name
```

### Step 3: Verify Fix
- Visit: `https://your-domain.com/organization-chart`
- Should now show all 7 committee member names
- Photos will show placeholder icons until uploaded

### Step 4: Upload Photos (Optional)
- Go to admin panel: `https://your-domain.com/admin/manage-organization-chart`
- Upload photos for each position
- Photos automatically upload to Cloudinary
- Database URLs are updated automatically

## Data Structure Created

The script creates this organization chart data:

```json
{
  "acting_president": { "name": "Puan Delima Ibrahim", "photo": null },
  "secretary": { "name": "Puan Sally Jong Siew Nyuk", "photo": null },
  "disciplinary_chair": { "name": "Cik Jenny Ting Hua Hung", "photo": null },
  "dev_committee_chair": { "name": "Prof. Dr. Mohamad Rahizam Abdul Rahim", "photo": null },
  "dev_member1": { "name": "En. Thor Meng Tatt", "photo": null },
  "dev_member2": { "name": "En. Mohammad @ Razali bin Ibrahim", "photo": null },
  "committee_member": { "name": "Cik Choong Wai Li", "photo": null }
}
```

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these are set in production:

```bash
# Database connection
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database

# Cloudinary (for image uploads)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
```

## Testing Locally

```bash
# 1. Setup organization chart data
node scripts/setup-org-chart-data.js

# 2. Start server
node server-new.js

# 3. Test page
curl http://localhost:3001/organization-chart
# OR visit in browser: http://localhost:3001/organization-chart
```

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Empty page with no names or photos
- ❌ Falling back to invalid Cloudinary URLs
- ❌ No database data

### After Fix:
- ✅ All 7 committee member names display
- ✅ Placeholder icons for photos (until uploaded)
- ✅ Data loaded from database
- ✅ Admin can upload photos via admin panel

## Maintenance Notes

- **Database Setting**: Data is stored in `settings` collection as `organization_chart_data`
- **Admin Panel**: Update via `/admin/manage-organization-chart`
- **Cloudinary**: Images automatically uploaded when admin uploads photos
- **Backup**: Script creates backups before modifying data

## Troubleshooting

### If page is still empty:
1. Check database connection: `node scripts/test-mongodb-connection.js`
2. Verify data exists: `node scripts/check-org-chart-data.js`
3. Check server logs for errors
4. Verify environment variables are set

### If images don't upload:
1. Check Cloudinary environment variables
2. Verify admin panel functionality
3. Check file upload permissions
4. Review server logs for upload errors

          <p class="text-lg md:text-xl font-semibold text-center">The Malaysia Pickleball Association (MPA) emphasizes the importance of standardizing all pickleball courts in Malaysia in accordance with internationally recognized specifications.</p>

          <p class="mt-4 font-semibold">All court owners are required to:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-2">
            <li><span class="font-semibold">Follow Standardized Dimensions</span> – Court measurements, markings, and net heights must strictly comply with MPA-approved dimensions to ensure fair play and consistent game quality across all venues.</li>
            <li><span class="font-semibold">Ensure Clear Line Markings</span> – Proper line width, color contrast, and surface finish must be implemented to prevent disputes, including “ball in or out” decisions. A well-marked court eliminates unnecessary arguments and upholds the integrity of the game.</li>
            <li><span class="font-semibold">Maintain Safety & Playability</span> – Surfaces must be non-slip and well-maintained, with sufficient spacing between courts, adequate lighting, and no obstructions within the playing area.</li>
            <li><span class="font-semibold">Provide Fair Competition Conditions</span> – All facilities must ensure that playing conditions are equal for all players, avoiding any modifications or unofficial adjustments that could give unfair advantages.</li>
            <li><span class="font-semibold">Support the Growth of Pickleball</span> – Owners are encouraged to work with MPA to promote community participation, organize events, and contribute to the development of the sport nationwide.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="mt-4">The MPA’s objective is to ensure that every player in Malaysia enjoys the game under the same professional standards, whether for recreation or competition. We seek full cooperation from all court owners to uphold these principles.</p>

            <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2 tracking-tight">SURFACE</h2>
            <p>Any hard surface (i.e. concrete or asphalt) will suffice for outdoor gameplay, so long as it’s free of debris. Grass will not allow the ball to bounce, but driveways or cul-du-sacs can work fine with enough space. Ideally, the surface area should be about 30 feet by 60 feet. For more professional and permanent outdoor court surfacing, there are sport surfacing systems and services available.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2 tracking-tight">NETTING</h2>
            <p>The net can be made out of any mesh material that will not allow a ball to pass through. It should be at least 21 feet 9 inches long, stretching from post to post; from the bottom edge to the top, it should be at least 30 inches wide. The posts should be 22 feet apart, and no more than 3 inches in diameter. Once the net is suspended from the posts across the center of the court, it should be 36 inches tall at the sidelines, and 34 inches tall in the center. The top edge of the net should have a cord or cable and it should be covered with a 2-inch tape.</p>

            <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2 tracking-tight">LINES</h2>
            <p>Lines can be made with chalk, tape, paint, or even crayons, but generally tape is the best option for DIY.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2 tracking-tight">INDOOR</h2>
            <p>The lines, netting, and space requirements for indoor pickleball play are the same as outdoor, but different lighting, fencing, and surfacing options are available, and should be considered. Indoor play allows for fluorescent lighting options that cannot function outside like HID and LED lights would. Indoor play also allows for different flooring options that are not feasible outdoors, like hardwood or rubberized surfaces. Fencing considerations can also vary more with indoor courts, as the surrounding environment does not pose as much a risk as it may outdoors.</p>

          <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3 tracking-tight">MPA Court Recognition Statement</h2>
          <p class="mb-3">To have a pickleball court officially recognized by the Malaysia Pickleball Association (MPA), the court owner must submit all required information and pay an annual fee of RM100 to MPA. Upon approval, a Digital Recognition Certificate will be issued to the owner.</p>
          <p class="mb-3">Recognition is valid for one (1) year only. Court owners must renew their application annually by submitting updated information and paying the RM100 fee to maintain certification.</p>
          <p class="mb-3">If the court fails to meet MPA standards during the evaluation process, the owner must carry out the necessary repairs or upgrades in accordance with MPA specifications and pay the fee again for a re-evaluation.</p>
          <p class="mb-3">Only courts with valid MPA recognition will be eligible to host official MPA-sanctioned tournaments or events.</p>
          <p>This process ensures that all recognized courts in Malaysia meet consistent, professional standards for safety, playability, and fairness.</p>
